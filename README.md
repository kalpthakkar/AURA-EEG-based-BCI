# üöÄ EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) with ESP32

## üí° Overview

This project implements an EEG-based Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) using the ADS1299 analog front-end and a 3-electrode setup (Fp1, Fpz, Fp2). The system is engineered to reduce neuro-signal latency by 3 seconds and achieves a 93% brainwave classification accuracy through machine learning-powered mental-state mapping. The primary goal is to enable early disease prediction and provide a foundation for assistive communication technologies.
